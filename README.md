This is a very old project that I did fresh out of Coding bootcamp. The code is really really REALLY bad, lol. I'm leaving it up because of the dedication I remember it taking me to finish this project. The complexity to me at the time was more than I ever expected to encounter, lol. I'll even leave the previous README to show how proud I was



```
This is a Customer Relationship Manager similar to Podio built using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, OAuth2.0, Google Calendar API, and FullCalendar gem. Certain files have been ommitted for privacy, so any clone will need to add their own Google API key, calendar ID, and client ID. All client secrets should be put in the root folder in a file called ".env"


Features include:
Full connectivity to the users calendar with the ability to add, edit, and delete events. 
Alert system that tells the user when they need to make contact with clients, alerts the user to any clients whose birthday it is, as well as reminds the user of any scheduled events for the day.
Add, edit, and delete users, clients, listings, agents, and vendors
A search feature
A step by step checklist built out in phases for listing transactions 
A transactions table that tells the user which listings are in which phases.
Password recovery 
```
