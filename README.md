This is a Customer Relationship Mapper similar to Podio built using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, OAuth2.o, Google API, and FullCalendar gem. I built this in 5 weeks.


Features include:
Full connectivity to the users calendar with the ability to add, edit, and delete events. 
Alert system that tells the user when they need to make contact with clients, alerts the user to any clients whose birthday it is, as well as reminds the user of any scheduled events for the day.
Add, edit, and delete users, clients, listings, agents, and vendors
A search feature
A step by step checklist built out in phases for listing transactions 
A transactions table that tells the user which listings are in which phases.
